# Gemini CLI Read-Only Mode

This file defines a “plan only” mode for the Gemini CLI.  When invoked with `/plan`, the agent may:

- Read any file in the project (e.g. `.py`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.yaml`, docs, etc.)
- Perform web searches or look at docs
- Analyze architecture, code style, and best practices

But **must not**:

- Modify, create, or delete any files
- Run any shell commands that write to disk
- Commit or stage changes in version control

---

## Usage

1. Place this file at the root of your repo (or in `~/.gemini/`).
2. Start the Gemini CLI in your project folder.
3. Enter `/plan <your question>` to trigger read-only analysis.

Example:

```bash
$ gemini
> /plan Report on best practices for Python (FastAPI) and React/TypeScript in our advanced options trading platform.
