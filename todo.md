  Options Pro Trader Review Summary (Score: 5.5/10)

  - Critical Finding: Dashboard lacks essential options trading functionality
  - Missing Elements: Options chains, Greeks analysis, IV data, position-level risk management
  - Priority Needs: Real-time options data, portfolio Greeks dashboard, strategy analyzer

  The dashboard successfully restored the rich dark-themed UI and provides solid general trading functionality, but requires significant
  options-specific enhancements to meet professional options trading requirements.
