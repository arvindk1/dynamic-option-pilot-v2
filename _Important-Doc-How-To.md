Dynamic Option Pilot v2 ‚Äî How-To & Go-To-Market Playbook
Audience: you and your engineering/product team (builder-operators). Secondary audience: technical beta users.

1) What this app is (and who it‚Äôs for)
What: A plugin-based options discovery & analysis platform (FastAPI backend + React/Vite frontend) that scans universes, computes indicators/Greeks, scores opportunities, and explains why a trade ranks well. Strategies are JSON-driven, so you can add or tune strategies without editing core code.

Who:

Power retail traders and pros who want transparent, rules-based scans.

Content creators / coaches who need repeatable ideas + explainability.

Quant tinkers who want to plug in new indicators, risk rules, or data feeds.

2) System Deep Dive (repo-aware)
Backend (FastAPI)
API: backend/api/routes/* ‚Üí strategy scans, dashboard, risk metrics, AI coach, debugging.

Services:

technical_analyzer.py (signal generation),

opportunity_scoring.py (rank + explainability),

greeks_calculator.py, earnings_intelligence.py, real_time_vix.py,

intelligent_llm_cache.py (LLM output cache), error_logging_service.py.

Providers (plugins): plugins/data/* (Alpaca, yfinance, cached wrapper).

Strategies: backend/config/strategies/development/*.json (+ backups).

Models/Migrations: error_log, opportunity, etc.

Frontend (React + Vite)
Dashboard & Tabs: src/components/TradingDashboard/*

Strategy Forms: UniversalStrategyForm.tsx, DynamicStrategyForm.tsx

Cards & Displays: TradeCard/*, StrategyDisplay.tsx

Context/State: contexts/StrategyContext.tsx

UX utilities: preset save/load, lazy tabs, perf utils

3) Quick Start (local)
Backend

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export APP_ENV=development  # or use .env
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
Frontend

bash
Copy
Edit
npm ci
npm run dev
Health + sanity

GET /health/ready ‚Üí see each service ok/ms

Try a strategy quick scan from UI (or POST /api/strategies/<id>/quick-scan)

4) Build Trades Your Users Trust (the ‚ÄúExplainable Scan‚Äù loop)
Recipe

Universe (tickers) ‚Üí providers (Alpaca, yfinance).

Indicators ‚Üí technical_analyzer.py (move toward an Indicator Kernel).

Scoring ‚Üí opportunity_scoring.py emits:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "overall_score": 0.83,
  "quality_tier": "A",
  "score_breakdown": [
    {"factor":"trend_strength","value":0.72,"weight":0.25,"contribution":0.18},
    {"factor":"iv_edge","value":0.81,"weight":0.30,"contribution":0.24},
    {"factor":"liquidity","value":0.66,"weight":0.15,"contribution":0.10}
  ],
  "profit_explanation":"IV edge + trend; watch 50DMA"
}
UI ‚Üí TradeCard shows big score, top factor chips, risk mini-panel (max loss/breakeven/margin), and earnings badge (only if before expiry).

Goal: Keep this contract stable; tune internals without breaking UI.

5) How to Add/Improve Strategies (fast path)
Duplicate a JSON in backend/config/strategies/development/.

Change: universe, entry/exit rules, DTE windows, strike deltas, liquidity guards.

POST to the scan endpoint; validate ranking & factors read cleanly.

Add a minimal form schema so UniversalStrategyForm renders it (if needed).

Commit a ‚Äúpreset‚Äù for demo screenshots.

Next: Introduce _base partials (risk_defaults / filters / sizing) and assemble at load to DRY the JSONs.

6) Engineering Improvements (you can ship incrementally)
A) Immediate UX (done or in progress)
ORJSON responses, /health/ready, /api/debug/errors/recent

Presets (localStorage)

Earnings proximity badge (expiry-aware)

B) Short term (1‚Äì3 days)
Scan progress modal (poll job status)

Risk mini-panel on card (max loss, breakeven, margin)

Pin & compare (factor deltas, risk side-by-side)

Empty states with recovery hints

Virtualize long lists; debounce param updates

C) Better Code (parallel)
Indicator Kernel (backend/services/indicator_kernel.py) with registry + vectorized funcs, used by analyzer & scoring.

Async pooled HTTP client (backend/services/http_client.py, refactor providers).

Explicit cache TTLs per data type; request coalescing in cached provider.

7) How to build a Twitter/X feed from app output
You already have scripts/services for X. The workflow:

Decide the content unit

A daily ‚ÄúTop 3 trades‚Äù thread per strategy with mini-explanations.

A single card per trade with emoji & concise reasons.

Add a ‚Äúpublish queue‚Äù (simple first)

Create a ‚Äúpublications‚Äù table or reuse your opportunity cache; mark items ready_for_tweet=true.

Write a small publisher service that pulls top items once/day.

Template your copy (deterministic + safe)

Example post:

bash
Copy
Edit
üìà Top Idea: $AAPL Iron Condor (45 DTE)
Score: 0.84 (Tier A)
Why: Trend ‚Üë | IV edge ‚Üë | Liquidity ‚Üë
Risk: Max loss $260, BE $192/$218
(Not financial advice)
Keep 240 characters; append an image only if you host a simple PNG chart (optional).

Wire it up

Use your twitter_automation.py / twitter_poster.py with env flags:

TWITTER_ENABLED=false by default

TWITTER_DRY_RUN=true for staging ‚Üí log the text, don‚Äôt post

Add a daily cron (server or GitHub Actions if you change your mind later).

Compliance guardrails

Add ‚ÄúNot financial advice.‚Äù

Avoid price targets; focus on why/factors and risk descriptors.

Rate-limit (e.g., max 5 posts/day).

Offer a link back to a read-only ‚Äúexplainer‚Äù page if you want traffic.

8) Go-to-Market: from project ‚Üí product
Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)
Power retail options trader (already on TOS/IBKR, uses OptionStrat/Tastytrade content).

Educator/coach who publishes daily ideas & wants consistent logic + images.

Small prop/PM who needs quick idea surfacing and explainability for team notes.

Positioning
‚ÄúExplainable options scanner with strategy presets and AI ‚Äúwhy‚Äù tips.‚Äù

‚ÄúJSON strategies you can edit; score breakdown you can trust.‚Äù

Pricing & Packaging
Free: 1 strategy, small universe, delayed data, no export, no Twitter.

Pro: all strategies, live scans, presets, compare, CSV export, daily email digest.

Team: shared presets, shared watchlists, simple roles, Slack/Discord webhook.

Channels (low-cost)
Twitter/X feed (daily ideas) + threads explaining a factor each week.

YouTube Shorts: ‚ÄúThis week‚Äôs Condor logic in 60s.‚Äù

Reddit/Discord (r/options, r/algotrading; your own Discord for feedback).

Product Hunt: after 2‚Äì3 features shine (compare, explainability chips, presets).

Content calendar (first 4 weeks)
Week 1: Explain your scoring factors (1/day).

Week 2: Strategy spotlights (Iron Condor, Credit Spread) with live examples.

Week 3: ‚ÄúFrom JSON to trades‚Äù tutorial (dev audience).

Week 4: Community presets showcase (invite users to submit).

9) Competition ‚Äî who you‚Äôll bump into (and your edge)
Categories (illustrative)

Options ‚Äúbuilders & analyzers‚Äù: OptionStrat (visual payoffs), Option Alpha (education & bots), Tastytrade (content + ideas).

Charting/TA w/ scanners: TradingView, TrendSpider.

Quant platforms: QuantConnect (C#/Python backtesting), Koyfin (analysis dashboards).

Broker tools: Thinkorswim, Interactive Brokers (deep but not explainable).

Your edges

Explainability out of the box (score breakdown + ‚Äúwhy‚Äù)

Config-driven strategies (easy to remix).

Automation hooks (Twitter feed, daily digest).

Pluggable analyzers (earnings intel, VIX, future ML plugin path).

Gaps to close

Real-time push (WebSockets), slick risk dashboards, backtesting, and polished mobile.

10) How you fare today (honest take)
Strengths

Clear modular architecture, quick dev velocity.

Already useful UX wins (presets, earnings badge), and explainability direction.

Easy to add strategies / forms.

Weaknesses / next moves

Consolidate indicator math (Indicator Kernel) to prevent drift.

Standardize scoring contract + factor set across strategies.

Add pin/compare and scan progress to feel modern and ‚Äúalive‚Äù.

DRY strategy JSONs with partials; explicit cache TTLs.

Opportunities

Niche: ‚ÄúExplainable options scanner‚Äù is under-served.

Partner with coaches/creators to seed presets & public leaderboard.

iOS companion (read-only first) is a differentiator.

Threats

Data/provider instability; rate limits; compliance scrutiny on auto-posting.

Big incumbents can copy features (but will be slower to launch explainability).

11) Can you turn this into an iOS app?
Yes ‚Äî API-first makes this straightforward. Strategy:

Phase A (2‚Äì3 weeks): Companion app (read-only core)

Features: Sign in, today‚Äôs top trades (score + chips + risk row), detail view with legs, presets picker (client-side), push ‚ÄúTop 3 ideas‚Äù daily.

Stack: SwiftUI + Swift Charts; Auth via token (Sign in with Apple optional).

Endpoints:

GET /api/strategies (list)

POST /api/strategies/<id>/quick-scan (server runs scan; client polls status)

GET /api/opportunities/<id> (detail)

GET /health/ready (diagnostics hidden in dev)

Notes: Keep scans server-side; mobile should never fetch full option chains. Cache the last result set locally for offline reading.

Phase B (2‚Äì4 weeks): Mobile-native extras

Push notifications (‚ÄúTop trades ready‚Äù at 9:35am).

Share sheet for Twitter screenshot cards.

On-device watchlist; ‚Äúpull to rescan‚Äù (server job + push when done).

App Store

Add disclaimers (‚Äúnot financial advice‚Äù).

No auto-execution, no promises of returns.

Age rating & restricted territories as needed.

12) Compliance, Safety, Guardrails
In-product: Show ‚Äúeducational only‚Äù badge on all trade outputs; link to risk overview.

Twitter posts: Always add ‚ÄúNot financial advice.‚Äù Limit frequency; avoid forward-looking claims.

Data: Never store API secrets in client apps; rotate keys; rate-limit public endpoints.

13) Your immediate blueprint (what to do this week)
Day 1

Progress modal (poll job status), debounce form inputs.

TradeCard hierarchy: big score, factor chips, risk row.

Day 2

Pin & compare sidebar.

Empty/Hint states; virtualize results list.

Day 3

Indicator Kernel (start with SMA/EMA/RSI/ATR/BB); refactor analyzer to use it.

Async pooled HTTP client in providers; set explicit cache TTLs.

Day 4

Twitter publisher (dry-run): pick top 3/day; render copy; log instead of posting.

Begin SwiftUI prototype (list ‚Üí detail using real API).

Ship small PRs; keep everything additive and feature-flagged.
